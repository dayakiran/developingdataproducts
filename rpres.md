Summary
========================================================

This application demonstrates the validity of Central Limit Theorem. Simply stated, this theorem says that for a large enough sample size n, the distribution of the sample mean will approach a normal distribution. This is true for a sample of independent random variables from any population distribution, as long as the population has a finite standard deviation.  

Dataset
========================================================

For this demonstration, we have made use of the various random distribution functions available in R.
Following distributions have been studied:

- Normal 
- Log Normal
- Exponential
- Uniform

Users can also select the following properties to generate the plot:
- Sample size
- No. of repititions.

Overview/Credits
========================================================

Central Limit Theorem is one of the fundamental theorems of probability theory. Through this application, we wish to ensure that the visual guide to better understand the phenomena.
